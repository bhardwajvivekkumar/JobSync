ðŸŒŸ JobSync

I noticed a real-world problem many job seekers face: keeping track of multiple job applications, interviews, follow-ups, and statuses across different platforms is overwhelming. Spreadsheets and notes quickly become messy, making it easy to miss deadlines or lose track of progress.

To solve this, I built JobSync â€” a smart job application tracker that helps users organize their applications in one place, track progress visually, and receive timely follow-up reminders.


||--What JobSync Does--||


--Functionalities--

Add & Organize Applications - Save details like company, job title, status, location, and tags.

Track Your Journey - See where you stand with applications: applied, interview, offer, or rejection.

Never Miss a Follow-up - Get notified when itâ€™s time to follow up.

Visual Dashboard - Clean charts to view:

Total applications count

Monthly trends (bar chart)

Status breakdown (donut chart)

Daily activity heatmap

Stay Updated â†’ Read job market blogs right inside your dashboard.

Successfully export you all job application in two dedicated forms PDF and CSV.


--Technology used--

Frontend â†’ React + MUI (Material-UI) + Typescript

Backend â†’ Node.js + Express

Database â†’ MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

Validation â†’ Zod (schema-based validation)

Auth â†’ JWT for secure login & registration

ResetPassword - AuthMailer
